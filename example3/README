We can see how easy is to add actions in the menu and in the toolbar using XML
configuration files. We can change the configuration files to modify the GUI
layout without recompiling the code.
To avoid to default behaviour, we can we use <DefineGroup> tag or even better
<ActionList> tag. In this example I changed the menu order and now, "Action 2"
is below "Component B" even if it was created first.

To build and run :
./build.sh # this will install the program to the kde prefix
kxmlexample # to run the program
make uninstall # to uninstall
