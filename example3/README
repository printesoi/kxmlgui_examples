We can see how easy is to add actions in the menu and in the toolbar using XML
configuration files. We can change the configuration files to modify the GUI
layout without recompiling the code.
In the example2 we saw the default behavior: entries are added in the order
that clients are created.
To avoid to default behavior, we can we use <DefineGroup> tag or even better
<ActionList> tag. In this example I changed the menu order and now, "Action 2"
is below "Component B" even if it was created first. We can also notice that
the two menus "Component A" and "Component B" now right after the "File" menu
without touching the C++ code, only changing the XML files.
