These are two small examples of how works the merging in the KDE XML-GUI
technology.

In the folder "example2" is the example of the default behaviour.
The folder "example3" shows a that using <DefineGroup> the default behavour can
be avoided, thus allowing the implementation of a tool that will let kipi-host
application to customize the GUI using XML configuration files.

Each folder contains a "build.sh" script that helps building, runing and
uninstalling the examples. It accepts the following arguments:
    build     -> only to build and install the example to KDE prefix. I have
                 tried to install in the $HOME but it does not work correctly,
                 but in the KDE prefix it works good, so you will be asked for
                 the root password to install the example.
    run       -> run the example.
    uninstall -> run sudo make uninstall in the build directory
