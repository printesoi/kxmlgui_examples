We can see how easy is to add actions in the menu and in the toolbar using XML
configuration files. We can change the configuration files to modify the GUI
layout without recompiling the code.
This example shows that entries in the menu are added in the order that
KXmlGuiClient-s are added. Look that because ComponentA is created first,
action "Action A 2" is located above action "Component B" both located in the
menu "Component B".
