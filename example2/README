We can see how easy is to add actions in the menu and in the toolbar using XML
configuration files. We can change the configuration files to modify the GUI
layout without recompiling the code.
This example shows that entries in the menu are added in the order that
KXmlGuiClient-s are added. 
The main window has tree menus : File, Settings and Help. ComponentA defines a
menu "Component A". ComponentB defines a menu "Component B". ComponentA has two
actions "Action A 1" plugged in the "Component A" menu and "Action A 2" plugged
in the "Component B" menu. ComponentB has a single action "Action B" plugged
in the "Component B" menu. Because the ComponentA is created first the "Action
A 2" is located above "Action B" in the "Component B" menu.

This example also show how easily actions can be plugged in the toolbar.
